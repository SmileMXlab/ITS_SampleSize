ITS_SampleSize: Code in R to support our article on "A simulation-based sample size estimation for interrupted time-series studies with count outcome"
=====

The "simcheck99.R" file contains the necessary functions and examples of sample size estimation for three cases (i.e., no autocorrelation, observation-driven, and parameter-driven autocorrelation). <br>
The "example.R" is an example of sample size estimation of the impact of the Expanded Programme on Immunization on Hepatitis A incidence. <br>
The other R files and the Rdata files are the simulation check codes.
